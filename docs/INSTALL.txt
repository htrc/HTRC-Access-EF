To install and run this software you need to have the following command-line
tools already installed:

  maven (>= v3.3.2)
  mongodb
  unzip
  rsync

While control is ultimately provided through Maven, to be consistent
with other source code projects in the Solr-EF search 'stack'
some top-level bash scripts are also provided.

File Preparation
================

Download the list of bzip2 JSON files from the rsync server into
the resources area used by the servlet:

  ./DOWNLOAD-LATEST-RSYNC-JSON-LIST.sh

A version of 'lcc-outline-treemap.json', used by the servlet to map
LCC codes to text, is already in the servlet's resource area, however
if this has been accidentally removed (or corrupted somehow), then
it can be regenerated by running:

  ./SETUP-LCC-PDF-JSON-TREE.sh


When the Jetty server is eventually started (see below), the files
in the 'src/main/resources' folder are copied into the servlet's
active web apps area (target/classes).

Compilation
===========

To compile:

  ./COMPILE.sh


Running the Service
===================

There are two servers that need to be run to deliver this web API:
MongoDB and Jetty

Depending on how your MongodDB has been installed, it may already
to running.  To check, run:

  ps auxww | grep mongo

And look for a line something like:

  /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

If not present, open in a text editor:

  ./START-MONGO-DB.sh

Review and edit as needed.  Then run it:

  ./START-MONGO-DB.sh
  

Finally, start the Jetty server:

  ./START-SERVER
